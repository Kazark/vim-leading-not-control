# Leading instead of Controlling in Vim

My left hand, arm and wrist get pretty beat up with sustained Vim usage—and my
Vim usage is sustained almost every since day. This project is an effort to
reduce that problem by avoiding holding down the <kbd>CTRL</kbd> key while
reaching for other keys in normal mode.

Note that while I am using the concept of a leader you do not necessarily have
to use your actual `<leader>` key for this, because that may interfere with
other mappings you have. You can configure which key you want to use with
`g:leading_key`. The default is `<space>`.
